**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Use single, self-contained repair commands instead of complex multi-step processes  
**Rationale**: Multi-step processes had interdependency failures; single steps are more reliable  
**Alternatives Considered**: Complex multi-step rebuilds, direct file manipulation, external repair tools  
**Implementation**: Each repair strategy is one robust ExifTool command  
**Testing**: Validated against manually tested repair approaches  

#### ADR-020: Hybrid Unicode Handling for Repairs
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Combine argument files (for Unicode safety) with simplified commands (for reliability)  
**Rationale**: Need both Unicode path support and command reliability  
**Implementation**: UTF-8 argument files with `-charset filename=utf8` flags  
**Consistency**: Matches existing application Unicode handling patterns  

### Error Detection and Classification

#### ADR-021: Comprehensive Corruption Classification
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Classify corruption types to optimize repair strategy selection  
**Types**: EXIF structure errors, MakerNotes issues, missing metadata, severe corruption  
**Rationale**: Different corruption types respond to different repair approaches  
**Implementation**: Pattern matching against ExifTool error messages

#### ADR-022: Verification-Based Success Determination
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Verify repair success by testing actual datetime field updates  
**Rationale**: ExifTool may report success even when repair didn't fully work  
**Implementation**: Test datetime update after each repair attempt

## User Experience Design Decisions

### Transparent Corruption Handling

#### ADR-023: Silent Detection with Informed Choice
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Detect corruption silently, only surface repair choice when needed  
**Rationale**: Don't interrupt workflow unless user input is required  
**Implementation**: Show detailed corruption analysis only when corruption is found  
**User Control**: Clear choice between repair attempt and skip repair  

#### ADR-024: Comprehensive Progress Reporting
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Provide both real-time progress and detailed final reports for repair operations  
**Rationale**: Repair operations can take time; users need feedback and results summary  
**Implementation**: Simple progress during repair, comprehensive results afterward  
**Transparency**: Users know exactly which files were repaired and which strategies worked  

### Backup and Recovery Strategy

#### ADR-025: Accessible Backup Format
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Create backups with proper file extensions (e.g., `photo_backup.jpg` not `photo.jpg_backup`)  
**Rationale**: Users should be able to open and view backup files normally  
**Implementation**: Split filename and extension, append `_backup` to name part  
**User Benefit**: Backup files can be opened with standard image viewers  

#### ADR-026: Local Backup Storage
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Store backups in `backup` folder alongside processed files  
**Rationale**: Keep backups close to originals for easy access and management  
**Alternatives Considered**: Centralized backup location, temporary files, cloud storage  
**Implementation**: Create backup subfolder in same directory as source files  
**User Control**: Users can easily find and manage backup files  

## Performance and Scalability Decisions

### Adaptive Resource Management (Enhanced)

#### ADR-027: Mode-Aware Process Allocation
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Use different ExifTool process counts based on operation mode and complexity  
**Implementation**:
- Single File Mode: 1 process (investigation only)
- Full Processing Mode: 4 processes (batch operations)
- Repair Operations: Use existing process pool efficiently
**Rationale**: Match resource usage to actual needs  
**Impact**: Better system resource utilization and user experience  

#### ADR-028: Repair Strategy Optimization
**Status**: Rejected  
**Decision**: Optimize repair operations through intelligent caching and strategy ordering  
**Implementation**: Try cached successful strategies first, then fallback to full strategy chain  
**Performance**: Reduces average repair time for similar corruption types  
**Learning**: System becomes more efficient over time  

## Quality Assurance and Testing

### Comprehensive Validation Approach

#### ADR-029: Multi-Level Testing Strategy
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Test repair strategies at multiple levels - individual commands, integration, real-world files  
**Implementation**: Unit tests for repair commands, integration tests for workflow, manual testing with user files  
**Validation**: Each repair strategy validated against actual corrupted files  
**Regression**: Maintain test corpus of known problematic files  

#### ADR-030: Conservative Repair Defaults
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision**: Default to safest repair approaches first, only escalate to aggressive methods when needed
