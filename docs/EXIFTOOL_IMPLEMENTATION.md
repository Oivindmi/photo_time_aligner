# ExifTool Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document details the ExifTool integration in Photo Time Aligner, explaining the architecture, implementation details, and best practices developed through iterative refinement. The implementation now supports adaptive resource management for different operation modes.

## Architecture Overview

### Adaptive Resource Management (New)
The application now uses different ExifTool configurations based on operation mode:

- **Single File Mode**: Uses 1 ExifTool process for minimal resource usage and investigation tasks
- **Full Processing Mode**: Uses 4 ExifTool processes for maximum throughput and batch operations
- **Automatic Switching**: Seamlessly transitions between configurations based on user mode selection

### Core Components

#### ExifToolProcess Class
**Location**: `src/core/exiftool_process.py`  
**Purpose**: Individual ExifTool process management

**Key Features**:
- Persistent process with -stay_open flag
- Argument file communication for Windows compatibility
- Automatic restart on failure
- Thread-safe command execution
- Comprehensive metadata extraction with -a -u -g1 flags

#### ExifToolProcessPool Class
**Location**: `src/core/exiftool_pool.py`  
**Purpose**: Manages pool of ExifTool processes for concurrent operations

**Key Features**:
- Configurable pool size (1 for Single File Mode, 4 for Full Processing Mode)
- Thread-safe process allocation using queue
- Context manager for automatic process return
- Parallel batch metadata reading
- Graceful shutdown handling

#### ExifHandler Class

## Performance Architecture

### Adaptive Process Management (New)
The key innovation is adaptive resource allocation:

#### Single File Mode
- **Process Count**: 1 ExifTool process
- **Use Case**: Individual file investigation and metadata examination
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal CPU and memory footprint
- **Performance**: Optimized for single-file operations
- **User Experience**: Responsive investigation without resource overhead

#### Full Processing Mode
- **Process Count**: 4 ExifTool processes
- **Use Case**: Batch processing and file synchronization
- **Resource Usage**: Maximum available resources for throughput
- **Performance**: Parallel processing with high throughput
- **User Experience**: Fast batch operations with progress feedback

### Mode Switching Logic
```python
# Enter Single File Mode
exif_handler.exiftool_pool.shutdown()  # Stop all 4 processes
exif_handler._single_process = ExifToolProcess()  # Create 1 process
exif_handler._single_process.start()

# Exit Single File Mode  
exif_handler._single_process.stop()  # Stop single process
exif_handler.exiftool_pool = ExifToolProcessPool(pool_size=4)  # Create 4 processes
```

### Process Pool Benefits
- **Full Processing Mode**: Eliminates process startup overhead, enables true parallel processing
- **Single File Mode**: Minimal resource usage while maintaining functionality
- **Adaptive Scaling**: Resources scale with actual needs

### Async Operations (Full Processing Mode Only)
- Non-blocking directory traversal
- Concurrent metadata extraction
- UI remains responsive during long operations
- Efficient resource utilization

## Implementation Details

### Process Lifecycle Management

```python
# Single File Mode startup sequence
1. Shutdown existing process pool
2. Create single ExifTool process with -stay_open flag
3. Verify connection with version check
4. Ready for single-file operations

# Full Processing Mode startup sequence
1. Stop single process (if exists)
2. Create pool of 4 ExifTool processes
3. Each process starts with -stay_open flag
4. Verify all connections
5. Ready for batch operations

# Shutdown sequence (both modes)
1. Send -stay_open False command to all processes
2. Wait for graceful termination (2s timeout per process)
3. Force terminate if needed
4. Clean up resources
```

### Command Execution Patterns

#### Standard Metadata Reading (Both Modes)
```python
# Single file operation (used in both modes)
cmd = [
    '-json',
    '-charset', 'filename=utf8',
    '-time:all',
    '-make',
    '-model',
    '-@', arg_file_path
]
```

#### Batch Processing (Full Processing Mode Only)
```python
# Batch processing with JSON output
cmd = [
    '-json',
    '-charset', 'filename=utf8',
    '-time:all',
    '-make',
    '-model',
    '-@', arg_file_path  # Multiple files in argument file
]
```

#### Comprehensive Metadata Investigation (Both Modes)
```python
# Single-file comprehensive extraction
cmd = [
    '-a',           # Allow duplicate tags
    '-u',           # Unknown tags
    '-g1',          # Group by category level 1
    '-charset', 'filename=utf8',
    '-@', arg_file_path  # Single-file argument file
]
```

#### Metadata Updates (Full Processing Mode Only)
```python
# Time field updates with argument files
cmd = [
    '-charset', 'filename=utf8',
    '-overwrite_original',
    '-CreateDate=2023:12:25 14:30:22',
    '-ModifyDate=2023:12:25 14:30:22',
    '-@', arg_file_path
]
```

### Adaptive Operation Selection (New)

#### ExifHandler Metadata Reading
```python
def read_metadata(self, file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Read metadata using appropriate process management"""
    if hasattr(self, '_single_process') and self._single_process:
        # Single File Mode: Use dedicated single process
        return self._single_process.read_metadata(file_path)
    else:
        # Full Processing Mode: Use process pool
        with self.exiftool_pool.get_process() as process:
            return process.read_metadata(file_path)
```

#### Comprehensive Metadata Investigation
```python  
def get_comprehensive_metadata(self, file_path: str) -> str:
    """Get comprehensive metadata using appropriate process"""
    if hasattr(self, '_single_process') and self._single_process:
        # Single File Mode: Use single process
        return self._single_process.get_comprehensive_metadata(file_path)
    else:
        # Full Processing Mode: Use pool process
        with self.exiftool_pool.get_process() as process:
            return process.get_comprehensive_metadata(file_path)
```

### Argument File Strategy

**Rationale**: Windows command line length limits and special character handling

**Implementation**:
- Temporary files with UTF-8 encoding
- One filename per line
- Automatic cleanup after processing
- Consistent approach across all operations

**Benefits**:
- Handles long file paths reliably
- Supports Unicode characters in filenames
- Avoids command line length limits
- Consistent error handling

### Error Handling and Recovery

```python
# Mode-aware process recovery strategy
if single_file_mode:
    1. Detect single process failure
    2. Log error details
    3. Restart single process automatically
    4. Retry failed operation
else:
    1. Detect pool process failure
    2. Log error details  
    3. Restart failed process in pool
    4. Retry operation with different process
    5. Fall back to individual processing if needed
```

## Operation Types

### 1. Single File Investigation (Single File Mode)
**Use Case**: Quick metadata examination without processing overhead  
**Process Count**: 1 ExifTool process  
**Flags**: `-json -charset filename=utf8 -time:all -make -model` or `-a -u -g1`  
**Output**: Structured JSON or comprehensive grouped text  
**Batch Size**: 1 file per operation  
**Resource Usage**: Minimal  

### 2. Standard Metadata Reading (Full Processing Mode)
**Use Case**: Reading basic metadata for time alignment  
**Process Count**: Up to 4 ExifTool processes  
**Flags**: `-json -charset filename=utf8 -time:all -make -model`  
**Output**: Structured JSON for easy parsing  
**Batch Size**: 20 files per operation  
**Resource Usage**: High throughput  

### 3. Comprehensive Metadata Investigation (Both Modes)
**Use Case**: Full metadata exploration for user investigation  
**Process Count**: 1 process (Single File Mode) or 1 from pool (Full Processing Mode)  
**Flags**: `-a -u -g1 -charset filename=utf8`  
**Output**: Grouped text format with all available metadata  
**Batch Size**: 1 file per operation (single-file focused)  

**Key Differences**:
- **-a**: Allow duplicate tags (comprehensive coverage)
- **-u**: Extract unknown/undocumented tags
- **-g1**: Group output by category (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, etc.)
- **Single-file**: Avoids batch processing performance issues

### 4. Metadata Updates (Full Processing Mode Only)
**Use Case**: Applying time adjustments to files  
**Process Count**: Up to 4 ExifTool processes  
**Flags**: `-charset filename=utf8 -overwrite_original -FieldName=Value`  
**Output**: Success/failure confirmation  
**Batch Size**: Individual files with field updates  
**Resource Usage**: High for batch operations  

## Performance Optimizations

### Adaptive Resource Allocation (New)
- **Single File Mode**: Minimal resource usage with single process
- **Full Processing Mode**: Maximum throughput with process pool
- **Automatic Switching**: Seamless resource management during mode changes
- **Memory Efficiency**: Resources scale with actual needs

### Process Management
```python
# Configuration options (mode-dependent)
single_file_mode:
    process_count = 1        # Minimal resources
    batch_size = 1          # Single file operations
    
full_processing_mode:
    process_count = 4        # Maximum throughput
    batch_size = 20         # Batch operations
    timeout = 30.0          # Process allocation timeout
    max_retries = 3         # Automatic retry attempts
```

### Concurrent Operations (Full Processing Mode)
- **Metadata Reading**: 4x parallel ExifTool processes
- **File Scanning**: Async directory traversal
- **UI Updates**: Non-blocking progress reporting
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic process restart

### Single File Optimizations (Single File Mode)
- **Dedicated Process**: Single persistent ExifTool process
- **No Batching Overhead**: Direct single-file operations
- **Minimal Context Switching**: Reduced process management overhead
- **Instant Response**: No pool allocation delays

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Mode Switching Problems
**Symptoms**: Application hangs when switching modes
**Cause**: Process cleanup/startup failure
**Solution**: Automatic timeout and retry with logging

#### Single File Mode Timeouts (New)
**Symptoms**: "No available ExifTool process" in Single File Mode
**Cause**: Single process failure without proper fallback
**Solution**: Automatic single process restart with error logging

#### Stack Overflow Errors (0xC0000409)
**Symptoms**: Application crashes when processing large file sets in Full Processing Mode
**Cause**: Large JSON responses exceed stack limits
**Solution**: Implemented process pool with batch processing

#### Empty Metadata Results
**Symptoms**: Comprehensive metadata returns "No metadata found"
**Cause**: Command format incompatible with persistent process
**Solution**: Use argument file approach consistently

#### Process Hanging
**Symptoms**: ExifTool operations never complete

# Full Processing Mode - uses pool efficiently  
with pool.get_process() as process:
    process.get_comprehensive_metadata(file_path)
```

### Selective Field Updates (Full Processing Mode Only)
Time synchronization can update specific field combinations:

```python
# Common field sets
datetime_fields = ['CreateDate', 'ModifyDate', 'DateTimeOriginal']
gps_fields = ['GPSDateTime', 'GPSDateStamp', 'GPSTimeStamp']
custom_fields = ['UserComment', 'Artist', 'Copyright']
```

### Batch Operation Optimization (Full Processing Mode Only)
Large file sets are processed efficiently through intelligent batching:

```python
# Optimization strategies
1. Group files by operation type
