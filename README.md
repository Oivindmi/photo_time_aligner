# Photo & Video Time Aligner

A Windows application for synchronizing timestamps across photos and videos from different cameras, with manual time adjustment capabilities, comprehensive metadata investigation tools, single file investigation mode, and **automatic corruption detection and repair**.

## Features
- **Dual Operation Modes**: Full processing mode and single file investigation mode
- Drag and drop interface for photo and video comparison
- Automatic detection of media from the same camera/device
- Batch time adjustment for all matching media files
- **Manual time offset** - adjust photos without needing a target photo
- **Single File Mode** - investigate individual files without processing groups
- **Comprehensive metadata investigation** - explore all EXIF data in your files
- **NEW: Automatic Corruption Detection** - identifies and repairs corrupted EXIF data
- **NEW: Intelligent Repair System** - multiple repair strategies with caching
- **NEW: Mandatory Timestamp Fields** - ensures all processed files get proper datetime metadata
- Support for 50+ photo and video formats
- Optional master folder organization with camera-specific subfolders

## NEW: Corruption Detection & Repair System

### **Automatic Corruption Detection**
The application now automatically scans files for corruption before processing and can repair most types of EXIF corruption:

- **EXIF Structure Errors** (e.g., "Error reading StripOffsets data in IFD0")
- **MakerNotes Issues** (e.g., "MakerNotes offsets may be incorrect")
- **Missing EXIF Metadata** (files with only filesystem dates)
- **Severe Corruption** (various structural problems)

### **Intelligent Repair System**
When corruption is detected, the application offers to repair files using multiple strategies:

1. **Safest Repair**: Minimal changes to preserve existing metadata
2. **Thorough Repair**: Rebuild metadata structure with force flags
3. **Aggressive Repair**: Complete metadata rebuild with minimal EXIF structure
4. **Filesystem-Only Fallback**: Updates filesystem dates when EXIF repair fails

### **Smart Caching**
The system learns which repair strategies work best for different corruption types and tries the most successful approach first in future repairs.

### **Automatic Backups**
Before any repair attempt, the application automatically creates backups in a `backup` folder, ensuring your original files are always safe.

## Operation Modes

### Full Processing Mode (Default)
- Two-photo alignment workflow for synchronizing different cameras
- Single-photo manual adjustment workflow for timezone corrections
- **NEW: Corruption detection and repair** before processing
- Batch processing of matching files
- Master folder organization
- Uses 4 parallel ExifTool processes for optimal performance

### Single File Mode (Investigation Only)
- **Purpose**: Quick investigation of individual file metadata without processing
- **Resource Efficient**: Uses single ExifTool process instead of 4
- **UI Simplified**: Processing controls disabled, focus on investigation
- **Perfect For**: Examining time fields, camera settings, and metadata before processing
- **Toggle**: Checkbox at top of interface for easy switching

## Enhanced Processing Features

### **Mandatory Timestamp Fields**
All processed files now receive these essential timestamp fields:
- **DateTimeOriginal** - When photo/video was taken
- **CreateDate** - When image was created
- **ModifyDate** - When image was modified
- **FileCreateDate** - Windows filesystem creation date
- **FileModifyDate** - Windows filesystem modification date

This ensures every processed file has proper timestamps in both EXIF metadata AND Windows filesystem, making them compatible with all photo management software.

### **Corruption Repair Workflow**
1. **Automatic Detection**: Files are scanned for corruption before processing
2. **User Choice**: If corruption is found, user can choose to attempt repairs
3. **Multiple Strategies**: System tries different repair approaches automatically
4. **Verification**: Each repair is tested to ensure it actually worked
5. **Graceful Fallback**: Failed repairs fall back to filesystem-only updates
6. **Progress Feedback**: Real-time progress and detailed final reports

   - Place `exiftool.exe` in `C:\Windows\` or `C:\ExifTool\`
   - OR add the ExifTool directory to your system PATH

## Installation
1. Install required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure ExifTool is properly installed and available (see ExifTool Installation section)

## Usage

### Single File Mode (Investigation Only) - Enhanced
1. **Enable Single File Mode**: Check "Single File Mode (Investigation Only)" at the top
2. **Drop File**: Drag and drop any photo/video into the reference zone
3. **Examine Time Fields**: View all available time/date fields with raw and parsed values
4. **Investigate Metadata**: Click "Investigate Metadata" for comprehensive metadata exploration
5. **Resource Efficient**: Uses only one ExifTool process for optimal performance
