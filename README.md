## NEW: Enhanced Corruption Detection & Repair System

### **Optional Corruption Detection**
The application now includes a toggle for corruption detection, allowing users to choose between:

- **Enabled (Default)**: Full corruption scanning and repair capabilities
- **Disabled**: Skip corruption analysis for faster processing of known-good files

### **User-Controlled Repair Strategies**
When corruption is detected, users can choose their repair approach:

#### **Automatic Mode (Recommended)**
- Tries repair strategies in order: Safest ‚Üí Thorough ‚Üí Aggressive ‚Üí Filesystem-only
- Automatically progresses until a strategy works
- Best balance of safety and success rate

#### **Force Specific Strategy**
- **Force Safest**: Minimal changes, preserve existing metadata (~90% success rate)
- **Force Thorough**: Rebuild metadata structure with force flags (~70% success rate)
- **Force Aggressive**: Complete metadata rebuild with minimal EXIF structure (~50% success rate)
- **Force Filesystem-Only**: Update filesystem dates only, skip EXIF repair (~30% success rate)

### **Enhanced Corruption Analysis**
- **Detailed Classification**: Files grouped by corruption type (EXIF Structure, MakerNotes, etc.)
- **Success Rate Estimates**: Shows expected repair success rates for each corruption type
- **Clean Error Messages**: User-friendly error descriptions without technical file paths
- **Repairability Assessment**: Clear indication of which files can be repaired

### **Advanced Backup Management**
- **Automatic Backups**: Created before any repair attempt with proper file extensions
- **Interactive Backup Browser**: Click any backup path to copy to clipboard
- **Color-Coded Results**: Green for successful repairs, yellow for failed attempts
- **Backup Path Export**: Copy all backup paths at once for external management
- **Detailed Backup Information**: Shows original file, backup location, repair strategy used

### **Smart Caching and Learning**
The system learns which repair strategies work best for different corruption types and optimizes future repairs accordingly.

## Operation Modes

### Single File Mode (Investigation Only)
- **Purpose**: Quick investigation of individual file metadata without processing
- **Resource Efficient**: Uses single ExifTool process instead of 4
- **UI Simplified**: Processing controls disabled, focus on investigation
- **Perfect For**: Examining time fields, camera settings, and metadata before processing
- **Toggle**: Checkbox at top of interface for easy switching

### Full Processing Mode (Default)
- Two-photo alignment workflow for synchronizing different cameras
- Single-photo manual adjustment workflow for timezone corrections
- **Optional Corruption Detection**: Toggle for performance optimization
- **User-Controlled Repair**: Choose repair strategy when corruption is found
- Batch processing of matching files
- Master folder organization
- Uses 4 parallel ExifTool processes for optimal performance

## Enhanced Processing Features

### **Mandatory Timestamp Fields**
All processed files now receive these essential timestamp fields:
- **DateTimeOriginal** - When photo/video was taken
- **CreateDate** - When image was created
- **ModifyDate** - When image was modified
- **FileCreateDate** - Windows filesystem creation date
- **FileModifyDate** - Windows filesystem modification date

### **Advanced Corruption Repair Workflow**
1. **Optional Detection**: Choose whether to scan for corruption (toggle at top of interface)
2. **Detailed Analysis**: View corruption details grouped by type with success rates
3. **Strategy Selection**: Choose automatic progression or force specific repair method
4. **Automatic Backups**: Files backed up with accessible paths before any changes
